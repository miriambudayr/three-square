Built using React, Redux, Tone.js. Three Square is a set of sequencers that produces minimalistic and cyclic music. The first two sequencers use the piano timbre while the third provides pad accompaniment playing 16x slower than the top sequencers. The user can introduce rhythmic syncopation by changing the number of beats per cycle. Three Squares also has note presets and customization.
